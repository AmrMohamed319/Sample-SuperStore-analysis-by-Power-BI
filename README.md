# Sample Superstore Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes the Sample Superstore dataset, offering descriptive and prescriptive insights through two interactive dashboards.

**The Descriptive Dashboard** allows users to explore historical data trends with dynamic visuals that update based on the selected analysis type. Users can choose from order, profit, profit margin, quantity, sales, and shipping time analyses, and filter data by date range, region, and state. Key performance indicators (KPIs) with color coding highlight performance trends. Visuals include bar charts for sub-category, region, category, ship mode, and state analysis, along with a line chart for trend analysis.

**The Prescriptive Dashboard** focuses on actionable insights and recommendations. Users can filter data by date and customize a scatter plot by selecting different measures for the X-axis, Y-axis, and KPI. The dashboard includes KPIs for current period sales, profit, and orders, a table displaying various measures with trend indicators, and a scatter plot showing relationships between measures for sub-categories.

Together, these dashboards provide a flexible and in-depth analysis of the Sample Superstore dataset, supporting informed decision-making through both historical data trends and actionable insights.
